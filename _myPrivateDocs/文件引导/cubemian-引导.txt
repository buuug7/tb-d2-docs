Defeater:


dont forget to add ''s when you use params


NefariusDX:

params are used like this no ' its ,

eg. uar,set,eth,sock=1 would create a set sacred armor which is ethereal and had one socket


dectgap:

Would you really be able to create a ethereal set item, or was it just an example? I have never got the ethereal part working anyway...




NefariusDX:

the order is important (how ever sets can never spawn as ethereal)
blizzard did this since if u would have 1 ethereal set item u would
need to have all the other parts of that set as ethereal to in order
to complete it how ever try it this way xh9,uni,eth,sock=1 will
create a ethereal socket vamp gaze (make the level for the stuff match!)
now xh9,sock=1,eth,uni would not work to my knowledge the code must
be ORDERED



ShadowTalon:

what i would like to know is all the output formulas for cubemain
such as the formulas that Sir_General uses on his rune mod
i know you can add prefixes to items ,but i want to know if you can
add the properties of the rune or gem in my case without typing up a
**** load of new prefixes and suffixes
so they would work the way i wanted them to


NefariusDX:

i didnt understand ur q, if u mean having them 'built in' to a item u just make a crafted item


Sir_General:

If you type 'useitem' in the output column and then put some stuff

in the mod1, mod2, etc. columns you'll get the same item you put in,

only with the added attributes in the mod1, mod2, etc. columns.


ShadowTalon:


thx Sir_General, thats exactly what i wanted to hear


Myhrginoc:

One more output code for your list, 'hiq' to make an item superior.
And it gets the random affixes that go with superior grade. If 'hiq'
doesn't work by itself, use 'nor,hiq'.


NefariusDX:

thx Myhrginoc, if there is a hiq code then maybe there is a nor,low or loq


Ruvanal:

Yes, there is 'low' quality mod. edit:
Do not use with the 'nor' mod because you would be trying to apply 2
different quality levels to an item. I can't rember for sure but I
think there is a 'noe' mod for 'not ethereal'. I need to try
checking a lot of scattered notes to see if there are any other odd
ones out there.


NefariusDX:

tell me when your sure these are correct ill add em for now



Ruvanal:

Double-checked the lists that I have. The 'noe' is for 'not
ethereal' and is normally used on the input tests. I only see 2
other that you did not have in your list 'any' and 'upg'. From the
various reports that I have heard from other I cannot recommend
using the 'any' modifier as it usually causes more problems than it
will help with. The 'upg' is for 'upgrade' and is used on the inputs
to allow the upgrade forms of a specific item to be used also (e.g.
an input of mbt,mag,upg would allow the mag Chain boots, mag Mesh
boots or mag Boneweave boots to be used as valid inputs).
Also a note on the outputs. If you don't specify a quality type
(low, nor, hiq, mag, rar, crf, set, uni) then the game will spawn
the item similar to an item drop and you can get an unplanned
magical quality level. I do not know if the magic find you are
equipped with will effect this type of drop or not. I ran into this
when I was trying to test something and neglected to put a 'nor'
quality in the output line and ended up with an ethereal magical
version of what I was trying to test (I did not want either
attribute and had to start the test run over again).
Also a note on the 'sock=#' output code for those that are not aware
of it. When this is used in the output column, you will be limited
in the number of sockets as specified by the item, the ilvl (using
the MaxSockX columns from itemtypes.txt) and the max sockets based
on the magical quality of the item (magic MaxSock=3; set, rare,
crafted and unique will get a MaxSock=1). If you need to exceed this
amount you will need to put the socket value in one of the sets on
mod columns instead (you still will not be able to exceed the values
for the item and the itemtype limits).
If your output code specifies a condition that is not possible for
then the formula will not work in that case. Example: input code
weap with an out put code of usetype,nor,sock=6, using a sword would
work, but if you used a javelin then the formula would be
non-functional (assuming you have not enabled sockets on this type
of item). This type of problem is probably what has caused a lot of
difficulties when modders are trying to use 'any' code.


NefariusDX:

i didnt add any due to that reason

i didnt know about the other 1 though for upgrade
